* [How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?](https://javascript.info/operators#remainder)
Provides the remainder between of the 1st number when divided by the 2nd number. 

* [Explain the difference between `==` and `===`.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp)

postfixing returns the original value of 'x' then increments it.

* [What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?](https://javascript.info/operators#operator-precedence)
its essentially like pemdas except the unary plus and minus signs for positive
